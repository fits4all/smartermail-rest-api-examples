This is a method for calling SM API functions via powershell. Also added a method to securely encrypt and store passwords.

## EncPwGenForm.ps1

When ran a form will open (cli version planned). This form will convert the password to be stored in an encrypted string. Other powershell scripts calling the password values will need to be ran by the user that generated the password initially.

For the url, just put the bare url (no http or https). This value is also used to name the file.

## SMApiExamples.ps1

This is a collection of SM Api Calls. If there is a specific call needing demonstration, let me know.
